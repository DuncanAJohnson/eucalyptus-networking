# ESP32 networking work by Duncan Johnson

Everything is in the software/networking folder. We're connecting to a Modal endpoint.

## ESP32 WiFi Bridge

There are two files, esp32_wifi_bridge.py and computer_wifi_bridge.py. If you run the computer_wifi_bridge.py file on your computer and the esp32_wifi_bridge.py file on the ESP32, you should be able to send messages back and forth.

## ESP32 Websocket

This code is in websockettest.py with support from websocket.py. I couldn't get it to work with the Modal endpoint, I think because the Modal endpoint doesn't allow for non-secure websocket connections and this websocket.py is designed for non-secure connections.

## ESP32 HTTP POST Interaction

This code is in post_interaction.py. It sends an "execute" HTTP POST request to the Modal endpoint when the user pressed the black button on the SmartMotor.

Every 0.1 seconds, it sends a "position" HTTP POST request to the Modal endpoint to get the current position of the SmartMotor. Not sure why I'm not using an HTTP GET request for this.
